-----------------------------------------------------------
How to get a two:
-----------------------------------------------------------
- [X] Two user types: Student and Helper

- [X] As a student I want to log in and have the ability to see tickets that are currently open for help.

- [X] As a student I want to be able to create a new help ticket with a title, description, what I've tried and a category (i.e. React).

- [X] As a helper I want to be able to login and see a list of open tickets. 

- [X] As a helper I want to be able to assign a ticket to myself by clicking a "help student" button.

- [X] As a helper I want to be able to mark the ticket as "resolved", or re-assign the ticket back to the queue if I cannot resolve the ticket.

- [X] Student built and deployed a Web API following the REST architectural pattern with code that is clean and organized using the Express Framework. Student can demonstrate that a portion of the APIs were contributed individually.

- [X] Student deployed an application with data persistence with a normalized data model that ensures data integrity and consistency. Student can demonstrate that they leveraged data persistence in their APIs that they contributed individually.

- [X] Student deployed a working application with authentication service that prevents access to endpoints that should not be public. Student can demonstrate they individually contributed to or leveraged authentication system.

- [X] Student deployed solution with automated unit tests for core business logic. Student can demonstrate tests they contributed individually.

- [X] Student's work demonstrates that all MVP features were built

- [X] Student successfully collaborated with colleagues, and handled any problems or friction appropriately.
-----------------------------------------------------------
How to get a three:
-----------------------------------------------------------

- [ ] Build an integrated slack-bot that allows students to submit help tickets through slack. Allow the ability to subscribe to the Queue in slack to be notified if someone opens a ticket.
	Slack action to create ticket -- > send from Slack API to our API
	On ticket creation or ticket status change, send notification to slack api
	Slack API notifies Slackbot that there's a new ticket/status change
	Slackbot receives that notification and notifies subscriber/user

- [X] Make it so a user can be both a student and a helper.

- [X] The project has end to end tests using a test database.

- [X] Student added authorization and authentication services.

- [X] Student migrated from SQLite3 to use a server RDBMS, like Postgres or MySQL and incorporated seeding scripts in their solution.

- [X] Student incorporated services interfaces and appropriate repositories for code reuse and deployed the API to a hosting platform.

- [X] The API is configured to dynamically load configuration and secrets using environment variables.

- [X] 2 + student helped others collaborate, smoothed out conflicts, and significantly contributed to marketing/explaining the project to stake holders beyond the team

- [X] Student's work demonstrates that all MVP features were built and the student went above and beyond the project.
